      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        About:<br>
        Here I will create a small biography about me and my history with art so the client can know a bit more about me.<br><br>

        MEET DICMARY ZAMBRANO<br>
        (Explain how Dicmary Zambrano started creating art) Hi! My name is Dicmary Zambrano, I am a 20-year-old digital artist from<br>
        Venezuela that dedicates their life to learning and creating art. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved to learn new things.<br>
        Arts and crafts, painting and drawing even sewing. If it meant I could bring something new to the world be sure I was doing it!<br><br>
        
        (Show how Dicmary Zambrano's caught people's interest with her art) When I was in high school, I started to take drawing more seriously,<br>
        and people started to come to me asking if I could make them a drawing. Before I knew I started to be recognized as a talented artist around<br>
        school, this encouraged me to keep working on my skills and nowadays I am still teaching myself how to be even better than yesterday. I started<br>
        to do commission in the hopes I could keep funding my education while I create beautiful illustrations for people.<br><br>
        
        (Share Dicmary Zambrano's passion about her art career) There is just something very special in seeing people get exited when they see the<br>
        art I made for them, it is a satisfying experience and shading my art with people is what has helped me get this far. I am very grateful for<br>
        all the people that find value in what I do and I will do my best to keep creating for all of them.
