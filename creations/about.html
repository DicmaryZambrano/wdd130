            <h2>MEET THE ARTIST</h1>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Dicmary Zambrano, I am a 20-year-old digital artist from
                Venezuela that dedicates their life to learning and creating art. Ever since 
                I was a little kid, I loved to learn new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arts and crafts, painting and drawing even sewing. 
                If it meant I could bring something new to the world be sure I was doing it!
            </p>

            <p>
                When I was in high school, I started to take drawing more seriously,
                and people started to come to me asking if I could make them a drawing. 
                Before I knew I started to be recognized as a talented artist around
                school, this encouraged me to keep working on my skills and nowadays I 
                am still teaching myself how to be even better than yesterday. I started
                to do commission in the hopes I could keep funding my education while I 
                create beautiful illustrations for people.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is just something very special in seeing people get exited when they see the
                art I made for them, it is a satisfying experience and shading my art with people is 
                what has helped me get this far. I am very grateful for all the people that find value 
                in what I do and I will do my best to keep creating for all of them. 
            </p>
